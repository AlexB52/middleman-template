# Middleman Template
This is the simplest middleman up with webpack as the external pipeline I could come up with:

It includes:
* webpack
* Stimulus JS
* Turbolinks

## Development
Run those commands to launch the project locally. It will be available here: http://localhost:4567/
```
bundle install
npm install 
middleman server
```
